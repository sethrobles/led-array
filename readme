# KiCad LED Array ðŸš§ (Work in Progress)

This project is a custom PCB built in **KiCad** that drives a 32Ã—32 LED matrix using an **STM32 microcontroller**.

The design features:
- **8 NFETs** for row/column control
- **16 shift registers (74HC595)** for serial-to-parallel expansion
- A hierarchical schematic setup for scalability

### Inspiration
This project was inspired (and guided) by my friend [@floreacton](https://github.com/floreacton).

## Current Status
ðŸš§ **In Progress**
This design is still being prototyped. Expect changes to both the schematic and PCB layout as I refine the design.

---

## Goals
- [ ] Finish schematic design and ERC checks
- [ ] Route PCB with proper 4-layer stackup
- [ ] Order prototype boards from JLCPCB
- [ ] Test LED scanning with STM32 firmware
